== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why should i go with your plugin? =
We are very proud of our woocommerce Google feed manager and we think it is the most powerful plugin out there build by Product Feed Marketeers especially for woocommerce powered shops. Our plugin will help you to get the most out of your Google shopping account.

The power of the plugin is that you can add the data from your shop to any feed attribute required, recommended or supported by Google. Next to that you are able to alter the data from you wordpress woocommerce database so you can optimize the data you send to Google. We support custom product fields and product variations making our plugin even stand out more from the competition.

While you grow with your webshop you can start working with our Premium plugin for even more powerful features and even more channel to sell your products on.

= How does the Google feed manager plugin work? =
Basically the plugin will generate a xml product feed valid for the Google product feed guidelines. It will take the data from your woocommerce powered online shop and create a valid Google product feed. The plugin will automatically update the feed to reflect the changes of your products so the xml feed will contain the correct product data. 

The only thing you have to do is add the xml feed url to your Merchant center and start selling in Google.

= Any Issues? Start here =
Start with the next steps when you have any issue with your installation and plugin.

First make sure you have all your plugins, theme and wordpress updated to the latest version. Follow woocommerce requirements as a minimum for the use of our plugin.

PHP 5.6 or greater
MySQL 5.6 or greater
WP Memory limit of 256 MB or higher for larger shops
If you have all of that sorted please follow the next steps before contacting us.

Deactivate and then activate the plugin. Test the issue.
If that does not resolve the issue, deactivate and reinstall the plugin over the current installation. Than activate it again and test the issue.
If it still does not work, remove the plugin through the plugins page (be aware, this will also delete all existing feeds) and reinstall it. Then test the issue again.

If the problem still exists, contact our support.

= Feed Warning, invalid xml feed =
There can be many reasons why a feed is invalid. We have build the feed in such a manner that it will only happen very sporadic.

In case it does please do submit your feed in your Google Merchant center and check what is going on in your feed in the Feed debugger from Google. It is very powerful and spot on.
